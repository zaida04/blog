# Preface

My story starts in 2020. I had heard about this platform that was becoming popular called Guilded.
Guilded is a Discord competitor that offers features typically would require Discord Nitro like 500mb uploads and other fancy features like calendar channels, forums, and more. 
While I'm fine paying for Discord Nitro, hearing about an alternative piqued my curiosity. 
And so, I joined Guilded in October 2020. At that point, I was mainly working on Discord bots. But, there was a problem.
The Discord bot ecosystem felt saturated, with many existing, high-quality bots making it tough for newcomers like me. 
As a high schooler with a dream of making something that would be of use to people, I saw Guilded as a fresh opportunity.
  
When I joined Guilded, I discovered there was no official API and no community bots. 
Undeterred, I reverse-engineered the site to interact with the client API and created a library called [`@guildedjs/guilded.js`](https://github.com/zaida04/g.js-self) (since `guilded.js` was already taken). 
It was a fun learning experience, and I managed to make it usable for other developers. Despite being in a gray area, a solid amount of people used my library for their projects. It was the reinforcement I needed to keep going.

Things started slowing down after a year or so, as I had covered most of the meaningful routes in the client API. It wasn't until I received a DM from a staff member at Guilded, in July of 2021, about being invited to their early access for their official bot API. 
I was over the moon. The second I joined the early access, I started working on churning out the next verison of guilded.js. 
And at that point, I was in communication with the owner of the `guilded.js` package on NPM and I was able to receive ownership of the package.

Soon, the library was in a state where I could create basic bots with it. It was then that I created the first moderation bot on Guilded, titled [**Yoki**](https://yoki.gg).

# The Start of Yoki

Yoki originally started as a moderation bot on Discord. It was a bot that I used to play around with a lot of the API, but I never grew it beyond a handful of servers. 
I decided that I would bring Yoki to Guilded as a way to test out the new API and see if this was a market that I could capture. I spent months building Yoki in the shadows, and in that time I was able to bring onboard my wonderful partner `IDKGoodName`.

[We released Yoki in July of 2022](https://www.guilded.gg/Yoki/groups/2dXLMBPd/channels/e717da50-27cc-4734-927c-f66130bc915d/announcements/jyPLeABy). It was a hit. We had over 100 servers using the bot within the first month. We were ecstatic. 
We had a bot that was being used by people all over the platform. We were able to bring features that Discord bots had to Guilded, and we were able to do it in a way that was unique to Guilded.

We've steadily grown and kept our lead, beyond just having been lucky to be early. We were able to create a variety of features and commands that you couldn't find elsewhere. 
We had a project that we loved working on, and was taking off. This continued for over 1.5 years. We even made a powerful dashboard for our users to manage their servers with.

We were so popular, that we were featured on [Guilded's Official API Announcement Video](https://youtu.be/eZAbDXdHguc?si=ZITHcsfmf7H-3L5-&t=26), [Guilded's Twitter](https://twitter.com/teamguilded/status/1547234394787565568), and [Guilded's Blog](https://www.guilded.gg/blog/spring-update-2022). 
We were also showcased in a couple community videos as well, from creators like [No Text To Speech](https://youtu.be/0SvEHy2rqKA?si=Nl40dBZx-tqFVQFE&t=289) and [DrKeefy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5QTIpexhjg). 
At our peek, we had 4,500+ servers and over 200,000+ members under our management. 
We scanned over 50,000,000 messages, 100,000 images, and generated over 50,000 captchas.

# The Problems

But, as time went on, we started to see the cracks in the platform. 
Guilded was a platform that was growing, but it was growing in a direction that left the bot API without a lot of needed features. 
The API had a serious amount of bugs, and at times this was a source of frustration. 
We were seeing bugs that were reported months ago still not fixed.
We were seeing API features that were promised months ago still not delivered. We were seeing the platform stagnate.

But, then we saw a potential saving grace. 
Guilded was acquired by Roblox, one of the largest games on the planet. 
We were excited. We thought that this would be the change that Guilded needed. We thought this would give Guilded the capital to hire more engineers, to iterate more on the API and deliver much needed changes.
We thought that this would be the change that would bring Guilded to the next level. 
We were even assured that ["Guilded will continue to operate as an independent product group."](https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2021/Roblox-Acquires-Guilded-a-Platform-to-Connect-Gaming-Communities/default.aspx). We had no idea how wrong we were.

Now, this leads us to May of 2024. 
Out of the blue, we were met with a blog post from Guilded that announced that you were required to have a Roblox account to use the platform. 
This felt like a dagger in the heart, because many, many people on the platform have never even played Roblox. The platform was advertised to us as a place for gamers and communities, not just Roblox users.
This was a decision that was made without any community input, and it was a decision that was made without any warning. 
We were blindsided.

This completely went against the previous assurance that Guilded would continue to operate as an independent product group. 
This was a direct integration that spoke volumes, saying "only Roblox users are welcome here". This was the final straw for us. 
The previous problems regarding slow API features and bug fixes were one thing (which was never solved either), but this was a complete disregard for the community that had been built up over the years.
Guilded had lots of die-hard fans, one member [even tattooed the logo on their arm](https://twitter.com/Xyphien/status/1796616296173285686). Other users gave up their Discord servers to move to Guilded, they made an investment in Guilded that it would be a safe space for their members.
We all gave years of our lives to this platform, promoting it free of charge, and it was all thrown away in an instant.

We decided that we could not continue to support a platform that was so willing to throw away its community. The same community that made it popular in the first place.
To be clear, we have nothing against Guilded itself. We love the platform, the staff, and we love the community that we have built up. 
But, if Roblox is willing to make decisions like these that completely shatter the existing users in favor of the bottom line, then we cannot continue to support it.

# The End

We made the difficult decision on July 1st, 2024 that [we were shutting Yoki down](https://www.guilded.gg/Yoki/groups/2dXLMBPd/channels/e717da50-27cc-4734-927c-f66130bc915d/announcements/7lxArak6). 
After 2 years of hard work, we had to say goodbye to our project.
This followed in solidary with a lot of the other moderation bots on the platform, like [Parrot](https://parrotbot.gg/), [Server Guard](https://www.guilded.gg/server-guard), and [EcoNuker](https://www.guilded.gg/econuker). Several of the other popular bots on the platform also shut down in protest of the Roblox integration.
These were some of the most popular bots on the platform, serving a large number of communities. We estimate around 10,000 are now going to be without a moderation bot.
This was a heartbreaking decision to make. I had spent over a year of my life making this bot, and it was coming to an end.

We had a wonderful community that we had built up, and we had to say goodbye to them. 
We had to say goodbye to the platform that we had grown to love. 
We had to say goodbye to the project that we had poured our hearts into.

Something I've learned from this experience is that you can't always predict the future. You have to cherish the things you have, the experiences you have, the people you meet. Because you don't know when it will all come to an end.
Another thing is that you have to stand up for what you believe in. If you see something that is wrong, you have to speak out against it. You have to make your voice heard. Even if it means making difficult decisions.
Always remember that companies can change in an instant. In the end, they have to make the decision that they feel is best for them in the long run. In that same vein, you have to make the decision that is best for you.

I want to extend a couple thank you's to some individuals that made this journey possible.

It was an amazing journey, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. But, it's time to move on. It's time to find a new platform to call home. 
It's time to find a new project to work on. It's time to say goodbye.

Goodbye, Guilded. It's been a wild ride.
